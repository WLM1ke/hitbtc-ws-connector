# hitbtc-ws-connector
This is fixed version of the Crypto-toolbox/hitbtc connector. Some initial functions of 
the package (like keeping connection alive and reloginning, resubscribing etc.) are broken.
However, on my view in its initial version at the Crypto-toolbox/hitbtc repository there are
certain issues: at least reconnection function (especially cmd history maintaining) should
be revised.
